## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Fixed

- Unable to install the generated JavaScript Bindings when packaged as a tarball
  by WAPM ([#59](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/issues/59))
- Don't assume atoms will have the same name as their commands
  ([#64](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/64))
- Some JavaScript bindings wouldn't run because the bindings always import
  `@wasmer/wasi`, while the dependency was only added when one or more
  libraries/commands was compiled to WASI
  ([#58](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/58))

## [0.4.1] - 2022-10-24

### Added

- User-facing documentation and a tutorial series are now available under the
  `doc/` folder ([#47](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/47))
- Mention the `wit-pack` version in each generated package
  ([#54](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/54))

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `*.wasm` files weren't being installed with the Python
  bindings from WAPM ([#52](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/52))

## [0.4.0] - 2022-10-12

### Added

- To facilitate caching or different means of distribution, users are now able
  to provide their own pre-compiled WebAssembly module when initialising
  libraries or running commands ([#45](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/45))

### Changed

- Removed the `LoadArgs` type from the Python bindings in favour of named
  arguments ([#45](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/45))
- Raised the MSRV from `1.59.0` to `1.61.0` to
  [match `minijinja`](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/blob/c5a09ebd/CHANGELOG.md#0210)
- Removed the top-level class from the generated bindings, so now you just need
  to do something like `from wit_pack import bindings, commands` to use the
  package's libraries or commands ([#40](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/40))

### Fixed

- Make the current directory available to the CLI when run by wasmer
  ([#37](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/37))

## [0.3.0] - 2022-09-27

### Added

- Set up CI to automatically deploy to wapm.dev whenever GitHub receives a
  tagged commit ([#24](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/24))
- Fleshed out the repo's documentation ([#25](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/25))
  - Populated the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Wrote up `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - Rewrote the `README.md` walkthrough
- Added a *"Time Reporter"* task to CI so we can keep an eye on CI times ([#25](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/25))
- Generate wrappers for calling WASI executables from JavaScript
  ([#26](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/26))
- Generate wrappers for calling WASI executables from Python
  ([#27](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/27))
- Detect all available WASI executables in a Pirita file
  ([#28](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/28))
- Add a top-level facade to the generated Python bindings so libraries and
  commands can be accessed through one common object
  ([#30](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/30))
- Add a top-level facade to the generated JavaScript bindings so libraries and
  commands can be accessed through one common object
  ([#34](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/34))
- Added a `wit-pack show` sub-command to show which libraries and commands would
  be generated from a Pirita file
  ([#35](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/35))

## Fixed

- Inspect each atom's kind when discovering the commands in a Pirita file instead
  of blindly assuming everything is a command
  ([#32](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/issues/32))

# [0.2.3] - 2022-09-15

## Fixed

- When run as a WASI program, the `wit-pack` CLI would unconditionally fail
  to load inputs because `mmap` isn't available ([#24](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/24))

# [0.2.2] - 2022-09-15

(no user-facing changes)

# [0.2.1] - 2022-09-15

(no user-facing changes)

# [0.2.0] - 2022-09-15

## Added

- The `wit-pack` crate now allows packages to contain multiple WebAssembly
  modules ([#22](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/22))

## ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changed ðŸ’¥

- The `wit-pack` CLI now takes a Pirita file as its only input
  ([#20](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/20))
  - This means the commandline interface has changed
    ```console
    # Instead of this
    $ wit-pack js --exports exports.wit --name hello_world --version 0.1.1 --module wit.wasm -o=wit-js --abi=none

    # you should now do this
    $ wit-pack js -o=wit-js ./hello-world.webc
    ```

# [0.1.5] - 2022-09-12

## Added

- Introduced support for WASI libraries ([#12](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/12))

## Changed

- The `crates/wit-pack-cli` and `crates/wit-pack-wasm` crates are now published
  to WAPM under the `wasmer` namespace instead of `Michael-F-Bryan`

# [0.1.4] - 2022-08-25

(no user-facing changes)

# [0.1.3] - 2022-08-25

(no user-facing changes)
